## Digimarc Mobile SDK for Apple Platforms
The Digimarc Mobile SDK (DM SDK) is comprehensive and robust scanning software for Digimarc Barcode (Product Packaging, Thermal Label, Print Media, and Audio) as well as the most common traditional 1D barcodes found in retail and QR codes.

Digimarc Barcode is a novel data carrier that encodes data in media in ways that are generally imperceptible to people, permitting the carrier to be repeated many times over the surface of the enhanced media. It delivers unprecedented ease of use, reliability, and efficiency in identifying the media due to massive mathematical and graphical redundancy.

The Digimarc Mobile SDK also includes support to optionally query the Digimarc Barcode Resolver for additional content and metadata related to the Digimarc-enhanced media your device is seeing and hearing in the world around you through the Digimarc Mobile SDK.
